Every major new release comes with its share of bugs. üêõüêõüêõ 

We've fixed the following and will continue with regular updates as we find more. If any of these has affected you, we are sorry for the inconvenience and thank you for your understanding...

* A bug that affected the ICIS-Air data exchange
* A bug that prevented saving changes to a SBEAP case log
* A bug that prevented saving changes to a SSCP notification log
* A bug that occurred when creating new facilities
* A bug that affected many ISMP report printouts
* A bug that prevented searching the Compliance Log by facility name
* A bug that occurred when opening applicattions with associated subpart data
* A bug that prevented all permit applications from showing up on the Navigation Screen when Unit View is selected

## Version 5.0 <span>(2017-04-28)</span> üñê

The database infrastructure that powers the IAIP has been completely changed. This effort took over a year and a half of planning with many months of hard work by our crack application development team. There are many people to thank for the success of this project, but at the top of the list are the Air Branch staff who devoted valuable time and effort to test the new application. Without your help, this would not have been possible. Thank you!

Overall, IAIP functionality should be the same as before, though we did take the time to fix many bugs in the user interface and in the database connection code. You should experience a more stable, less error-prone connection when using the IAIP. Hopefully, you will not notice the improvement.

Please bear in mind that the IAIP is a large application (with over a quarter-million lines of code), and it was impossible to test all user scenarios. If you encounter a bug or error while using the program, please contact EPD-IT and we will address it as soon as possible. 

Thanks for all you do in service to the environment and the citizens of the State of Georgia! ‚ô•
