A lot has changed behind the scenes in this update to make the IAIP more stable and secure for you. Some tools have also been changed to make them easier to use. For example,

+ *Everyone* -- New tools have been added to help you retrieve a forgotten username or reset a forgotten password. Account tools have also been added to let you update your profile or change a password.
+ *Managers* -- The tools for managing user accounts have been improved.
+ *SSCP* -- The enforcement form has been completely rebuilt to make data entry simpler and help prevent errors.

Many thanks to Sean, Sherry, and Peter for testing these changes and stopping lots of bugs before they got loose!
